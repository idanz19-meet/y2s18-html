	<h2> Labour Theory of Value </h2>
	<p> The labor theory of value (LTV) was an early attempt by economists to explain why goods were exchanged for certain relative prices on the market. It suggested that the value of a commodity could be measured objectively by the average number of labor hours necessary to produce it. The best-known advocates of the labor theory were Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Karl Marx.

	The labor theory of value suggested that two commodities will trade for the same price if they embody the same amount of labor-time, or else they will exchange at a ratio fixed by the relative differences in the two labor-times. For instance, if it takes 10 hours to hunt a deer, and 20 hours to trap a beaver, then the exchange ratio would be two beavers for one deer. Since it was developed in the 18th century, the labor theory of value has fallen out of favor among most mainstream economists. </p>
